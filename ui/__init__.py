"""
UI package for the Image Ranking System.

This package contains all user interface components:
- main_window: The primary voting interface
- rankings_window: Rankings display and analysis
- stats_window: Detailed statistics and analytics
- settings_window: Configuration and preferences
- mixins: Reusable UI components and functionality

By organizing UI components in a separate package, we maintain
clear separation between presentation logic and business logic.
