## üìà Understanding the Algorithm

### Tier System
Images are organized into tiers ranging from negative to positive values:
- **Tier 0**: Starting point for all images
- **Positive Tiers**: Higher-ranked images
- **Negative Tiers**: Lower-ranked images
- **Tier Bounds**: Intelligent limits that prevent extreme tier inflation

### Selection Process
1. **Overflow Detection**: Identifies tiers with too many images
2. **Confidence Calculation**: Evaluates image stability using voting history
3. **Strategic Pairing**: Selects low-confidence vs. high-confidence images within overflowing tiers
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Random selection when no tier overflow detected

### Confidence Metrics
Confidence scores combine:
- **Tier Stability**: How consistent an image's tier position has been
- **Vote Count**: Total number of comparisons (with square root scaling)
- **Recent Activity**: How recently the image was voted on

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Algorithm Parameters
- **Tier Distribution Standard Deviation**: Controls expected tier spread (default: 1.5)
- **Overflow Threshold**: When a tier is considered overcrowded (default: 1.0x expected)
- **Minimum Overflow Images**: Minimum images needed to trigger overflow detection (default: 2)

### Tier Bounds Settings
- **Bounds Multiplier**: How many standard deviations to allow (default: 3.0)
- **Minimum Confidence**: Confidence threshold to exceed bounds (default: 0.8)
- **Minimum Votes**: Vote threshold to exceed bounds (default: 10)
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Whether bounds grow with collection size (default: enabled)

### Selection Weights
Customize the importance of different factors:
- **Recency**: How recently an image was voted on
- **Low Votes**: Priority for images with fewer votes
- **Instability**: Priority for images with unstable tier positions
- **Tier Size**: Priority based on tier population
