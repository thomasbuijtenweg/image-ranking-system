# Image Ranking System

A sophisticated pairwise comparison system for ranking large collections of images through intelligent voting algorithms with AI-generated content support.

## Overview

The Image Ranking System helps you systematically compare and rank image collections by presenting them in pairs and asking "which one do you prefer?" This approach is psychologically easier than ranking hundreds of images at once and produces more consistent, reliable results.

Images are organized into a tier-based ranking system where they start at "Tier 0" and move up or down based on voting outcomes. The best images naturally rise to higher tiers while weaker images settle into lower tiers over time.

## Key Features

### üß† Advanced Pair Selection Algorithm
- **Dual-weight system**: Separate algorithm weights for left and right image selection
- **Multi-factor prioritization**: Considers recency, vote count, tier stability, and tier population
- **Smart tier distribution**: Uses normal distribution centered at tier 0 for balanced rankings
- **Priority preferences**: Configure whether to prioritize high/low stability and vote counts

### üé® AI-Generated Image Support
- **Automatic prompt extraction** from PNG text chunks, EXIF data, and PIL metadata
- **Intelligent prompt analysis** that correlates specific words with image tier performance
- **Word performance statistics** showing which prompt terms lead to higher-quality results
- **Metadata caching** for improved performance with large collections

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **Background processing** for metadata extraction from thousands of images
- **Image preloading** for smooth transitions between voting pairs
- **Memory management** and garbage collection for extended use
- **Progress tracking** with cancellation support for large collections
- **File system caching** to avoid repeated directory scans

### üñ•Ô∏è User-Friendly Interface
- **Dark theme** optimized for extended voting sessions
- **Image preview on hover** in rankings and statistics windows
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for efficient voting (arrow keys, letters)
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Real-time statistics** and tier tracking

### üìä Comprehensive Analytics
- **Multiple ranking views**: Sort by tier, win rate, total votes, or stability
- **Individual image tracking**: Complete voting history and tier progression
- **Prompt word analysis**: Discover which words correlate with higher rankings
- **Export capabilities**: Save rankings and word analysis to CSV files
- **Data validation** and integrity checking

### üîß Customizable Algorithm
- **Independent left/right weights**: Different priorities for each side of comparison
- **Stability preferences**: Choose to prioritize stable or unstable tier positions
- **Vote count preferences**: Focus on heavily-voted or lightly-voted images
- **Tier distribution control**: Adjust how tightly images cluster around tier 0
- **Real-time weight adjustment** with normalization tools

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.8+** if not already installed
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Select a folder** containing your images using "Select Image Folder"
2. **Start voting** by clicking your preferred image or using arrow keys (‚Üê for left, ‚Üí for right)
3. **View progress** in real-time as images move between tiers
4. **Analyze results** using "View Rankings" and "View Stats" buttons
5. **Save your work** regularly with "Save Progress"

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Left Arrow** or **A**: Vote for left image
- **Right Arrow** or **D**: Vote for right image
- **Ctrl+S**: Save progress
- **Ctrl+O**: Load progress
- **Ctrl+R**: View rankings
- **Ctrl+T**: View statistics

## Understanding the Algorithm

The system uses a multi-factor algorithm with separate weights for left and right image selection:

**New Image Introduction**: Unvoted images are paired with tier 0 images for initial positioning.

**Intelligent Matching**: Images are primarily compared within the same tier or adjacent tiers to refine rankings.

**Priority Scoring**: Each image receives priority scores based on:
- **Recency**: How recently it was voted on
- **Vote Count**: Total number of comparisons (preference configurable)
- **Stability**: How much its tier position fluctuates (preference configurable)  
- **Tier Size**: How crowded its current tier is relative to expected distribution

**Separate Selection**: Left and right images are chosen independently using their respective weight sets and priority preferences, allowing for asymmetric comparison strategies.

## AI Prompt Analysis

For AI-generated images, the system automatically:
- Extracts generation prompts from image metadata
- Analyzes which words correlate with higher tier rankings
- Provides statistics on word performance across your collection
- Helps identify effective prompt patterns for quality image generation

## Data Format

Rankings are saved in JSON format with complete voting history, metadata cache, and separate weight configurations. The system maintains backward compatibility while adding new features.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pillow (PIL)** for image processing
- **4GB+ RAM** recommended for large collections (10,000+ images)
- **Modern display** for optimal image preview experience
